  "readme": "# sass loader for [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)\n\n\n## Usage\n\n[Documentation: Using loaders](http://webpack.github.io/docs/using-loaders.html)\n\n``` javascript\nvar css = require(\"!raw!sass!./file.scss\");\n// => returns compiled css code from file.scss, resolves imports\nvar css = require(\"!css!sass!./file.scss\");\n// => returns compiled css code from file.scss, resolves imports and url(...)s\n```\n\nUse in tandem with the [`style-loader`](https://github.com/webpack/style-loader) to add the css rules to your document:\n\n``` javascript\nrequire(\"!style!css!sass!./file.scss\");\n```\n\n### webpack config\n\nIt's recommended to adjust your `webpack.config` so `style!css!sass!` is applied automatically on all files ending on `.scss`:\n\n``` javascript\nmodule.exports = {\n  module: {\n    loaders: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.scss$/,\n        // Query parameters are passed to node-sass\n        loader: \"style!css!sass?outputStyle=expanded&\" +\n          \"includePaths[]=\" +\n            (path.resolve(__dirname, \"./bower_components\")) + \"&\" +\n          \"includePaths[]=\" +\n            (path.resolve(__dirname, \"./node_modules\"))\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n};\n```\n\nThen you only need to write: `require(\"./file.scss\")`. See [`node-sass`](https://github.com/andrew/node-sass) for the available options.\n\n## Install\n\n`npm install sass-loader`\n\n## Caveats\n\nCurrently the sass-loader does not follow all of the webpack loader guidelines. The general problem is that the entry scss-file is passed to [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) which does pretty much the rest. Thus `@import` statements inside your scss-files cannot be resolved by webpack's resolver. However, there is an [issue for that missing feature in libsass](https://github.com/sass/libsass/issues/21).\n\n## License\n\nMIT (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)\n",
