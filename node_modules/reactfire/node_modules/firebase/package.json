Or, if you prefer to manage users yourself, you can maintain complete control using Custom Login.\n\n0. **Hosting.** With hosting, you can deploy your static website to the internet with a single command.\n\nAll of these services are built for security, reliability, and scale, so you can deploy your applications with confidence.\n\n## Node.js & Firebase\n\nWhile you can write entire Firebase applications without any backend code, many developers will still want to run their own servers. For these developers, we provide a full-featured Node.js module. This library has the same Javascript API and features as our web client.\n\nTo get started, install Firebase using npm:\n\n    npm install firebase\n\nNow, just require the library in your application and start using your data:\n\n    var Firebase = require('firebase');\n    var myRootRef = new Firebase('https://myprojectname.firebaseIO-demo.com/');\n    myRootRef.set(\"hello world!\");\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIf you haven't already done so, you should try our [tutorial](https://www.firebase.com/tutorial/index.html#gettingstarted). Next, we recommend checking out our [example apps](https://www.firebase.com/docs/examples.html) or reading on in the [docs](https://www.firebase.com/docs/).\n\n\n\n",
